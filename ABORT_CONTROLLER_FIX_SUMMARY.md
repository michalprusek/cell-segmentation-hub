# Export Cancellation Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-09-22

## Issue Description
The inline cancel button in the ExportProgressPanel (located below the segmentation queue indicator, above the image gallery) was not working properly. When clicked, it would create a NEW AbortController instead of aborting the existing one, preventing export cancellation from working.

## Root Cause
The bug was in the verification logic in both `useAdvancedExport.ts` and `useSharedAdvancedExport.ts`. After calling `abort()`, the code called `getSignal()` to verify the abort state:

```typescript
// BUGGY CODE:
abort('download');
const downloadSignal = getSignal('download'); // This created a NEW controller!
logger.info('Download signal aborted state:', downloadSignal.aborted); // Always false!
```

The `getSignal()` function internally calls `getController()`, which checks if the existing controller is aborted. If it is, it creates a NEW non-aborted controller, defeating the purpose of the verification.

## Solution
Instead of using `getSignal()` for verification, use the `isAborted()` method which safely checks the abort state without creating new controllers:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
abort('download');
const downloadAborted = isAborted('download'); // Safely checks without creating new controller
logger.info('Download signal aborted state:', downloadAborted); // Correctly shows true
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/pages/export/hooks/useAdvancedExport.ts`
- Line 83: Added `isAborted` to destructuring from `useAbortController`
- Lines 568-571: Changed from `getSignal()` to `isAborted()` for verification

### 2. `/src/pages/export/hooks/useSharedAdvancedExport.ts`
- Line 85: Added `isAborted` to destructuring from `useAbortController`
- Lines 685-688: Changed from `getSignal()` to `isAborted()` for verification

## Technical Details

### How AbortController Works
1. `abort(key)` - Aborts the controller and keeps it in the map (aborted state)
2. `getSignal(key)` - Returns signal from existing controller OR creates new if none exists
3. `getController(key)` - Returns existing if NOT aborted, otherwise creates new
4. `isAborted(key)` - Safely checks if controller exists and is aborted (no side effects)

### The Bug Flow
1. User clicks cancel button → calls `cancelExport()`
2. `cancelExport()` calls `abort('download')` → controller is aborted ✅
3. `cancelExport()` calls `getSignal('download')` for verification
4. `getSignal()` calls `getController('download')`
5. `getController()` sees existing controller IS aborted
6. `getController()` creates NEW non-aborted controller ❌
7. Verification shows "aborted: false" even though we just aborted!

### The Fix Flow
1. User clicks cancel button → calls `cancelExport()`
2. `cancelExport()` calls `abort('download')` → controller is aborted ✅
3. `cancelExport()` calls `isAborted('download')` for verification
4. `isAborted()` checks the existing controller directly
5. Returns true if aborted ✅
6. No new controller created, abort state preserved

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test-inline-cancel.mjs` - Tests the inline cancel button specifically
- `test-export-direct.mjs` - Tests abort controller directly
- `test-export-cancel-v2.mjs` - Comprehensive export cancellation test

## Result
✅ The inline cancel button now properly aborts export operations
✅ Downloads are prevented when cancel is clicked
✅ The abort controller state is preserved correctly
✅ No new controllers are created during verification

## Lessons Learned
1. When verifying abort state, use methods that don't have side effects
2. `getController()` is designed to provide a fresh controller if the existing one is aborted (for new operations)
3. For state verification, use dedicated check methods like `isAborted()` that don't modify state
4. Always test the actual user flow, not just the individual components
