"""Curvature-bounded arm pairing at a junction.

This replaces PySOAX's greedy "follow the straightest continuation" rule, which decides one
step at a time from a single 8-connected pixel step (quantised to 45 degrees) and can never
revisit a wrong choice. Here the junction is solved as a UNIT: its arms are paired by a
minimum-cost perfect matching, so the 4 arms of an X necessarily become 2 consistent
through-paths.

Two ingredients PySOAX lacks:

* a **hard curvature bound** -- a pairing whose implied ``|dtheta|/ds`` exceeds ``kappa_max``
  is not merely expensive, it is forbidden, because microtubules cannot kink;
* an explicit **"leave this arm open"** alternative priced at ``c_open``, so a genuine
  T-junction or a microtubule end is not forced into a spurious continuation.

Angle convention (see :func:`instance.geometry.window_tangent`): ``theta`` points from the
junction INTO the arc's body. Travelling through the junction from arm ``i`` into arm ``j``
means arriving on heading ``theta_i + pi`` and leaving on ``theta_j``, so a straight
through-path has ``turn_penalty(theta_i + pi, theta_j) == 0``. Signed curvatures measured
outward likewise SUM to zero across a smooth continuation.

    Without ``max_gap`` that is every pair, in the row-major order the nested
    loops produced. WITH it — the gap-linking call, where every free chain end
    in the frame is an arm — the pairs beyond ``max_gap`` are dropped, and a
    KD-tree finds the survivors instead of measuring all ``n(n-1)/2`` distances
    in Python.

    The KD-tree is used as a SUPERSET filter and the original test is then
    applied verbatim, so this is exact rather than merely near-exact.
    ``query_pairs`` and ``np.linalg.norm`` both compute ``sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)``
    but by different code paths (norm on a bare 2-vector dispatches to a BLAS
    kernel), so a pair sitting within an ULP of ``max_gap`` could in principle
    be classified differently by the two. Querying a hair wider than the gate
    and re-testing with the very expression the loops used removes that
    question entirely: the surviving set is *defined* by the old comparison.

    ``sorted()`` restores the row-major order, and that matters — edge
    insertion order is what ``nx.max_weight_matching`` breaks exact ties on, so
    a permuted candidate list could return a different (equally optimal)
    matching. Verified pair-for-pair against the nested loops on real
    production geometry — see ``tests/test_instancer_perf_identity.py``.

    Why it earns a function: at the gap-linking call the arm count is twice the
    CHAIN count, and chains are what a fragmented frame produces most of. On a
    real production frame (container 4972cad8, frame 0 IRM) that is 85 chains ->
    170 arms -> 14 365 pairs, of which **44** are within ``link_max_gap`` — 0.3 %
    — and the quadratic is the shape that misbehaves: a frame with 3x the chains
    pays 9x for candidates it will reject. Measured on that frame, interleaved,
    min of 3: the gap-linking ``match_junction`` goes 0.100 s -> 0.009 s and
