# Slice Mode Fix Testing Guide

## Test Steps

1. **Open the segmentation editor**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:5174/segmentation/[project-id]/[image-id]
   - Or use the test URL: http://localhost:5174/segmentation/755ddc19-47a3-4ff2-8af3-1127caaad4f0/fc177a2a-e2b8-44ae-a100-8ff70f81302c

2. **Test Slice Mode Activation**
   - Press 'S' key to activate slice mode
   - Check console for: `[useEnhancedSegmentationEditor] setEditMode called with: slice`
   - Verify that mode changes to slice (check toolbar or mode indicator)

3. **Test Polygon Selection in Slice Mode**
   - With slice mode active, click on any polygon
   - Expected behavior:
     - Polygon should be selected
     - Mode should REMAIN in slice mode
     - Console should show: `[usePolygonSelection] SLICE MODE - Selecting polygon, NOT changing mode`
   - Check that you're NOT switched to EditVertices mode

4. **Test Delete Mode**
   - Press 'D' key to activate delete mode
   - Click on a polygon
   - Expected: Polygon deleted, stays in delete mode

5. **Test Slice Workflow**
   - Press 'S' for slice mode
   - Click a polygon to select it
   - Click outside polygon to place first slice point
   - Click again to place second slice point
   - Expected: Polygon is sliced, no mode changes during process

## Console Debug Messages to Monitor

Look for these key messages:

- `[useEnhancedSegmentationEditor] setEditMode called with: slice` - Mode being set
- `[useEnhancedSegmentationEditor] Current mode before change:` - Shows current mode
- `[usePolygonSelection] SLICE MODE - Selecting polygon, NOT changing mode` - Confirms slice mode handling
- `[useEnhancedSegmentationEditor] isNewData triggered` - Should NOT appear during mode switches
- `[useEnhancedSegmentationEditor] Resetting to View mode` - Should only appear on image change

## Success Criteria

✅ Slice mode persists when clicking polygons
✅ Delete mode persists when clicking polygons
✅ No unexpected View mode resets
✅ Slice workflow completes without mode changes
✅ Console shows expected debug messages
