## Coverage Analysis

### Frontend Coverage Estimate

Based on test execution patterns:

| Module     | Estimated Coverage | Status                |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Components | ~45%               | ⚠️ Below threshold    |
| Contexts   | ~30%               | ❌ Needs improvement  |
| Hooks      | ~20%               | ❌ Critical gap       |
| Utils/Lib  | ~60%               | ⚠️ Approaching target |
| Pages      | ~15%               | ❌ Critical gap       |

### Backend Coverage

Unable to calculate due to compilation errors. Estimated based on file structure:

| Module      | Files | Test Files | Coverage |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Services    | 15    | 3          | ~20%     |
| Controllers | 12    | 0          | 0%       |
| Middleware  | 8     | 0          | 0%       |
| Utils       | 10    | 2          | ~20%     |

## Test Quality Metrics

### Test Stability

- **Flaky Tests:** High occurrence (~30% of failures are mock-related)
- **Environment Dependencies:** Tests fail due to missing context providers
- **Async Handling:** Issues with promise rejection handling

### Test Coverage Gaps

**Critical Untested Areas:**

1. **Authentication Flow:** Token refresh mechanism
2. **File Upload:** Progress tracking and error handling
3. **WebSocket:** Real-time event handling
4. **ML Pipeline:** Model inference and postprocessing
5. **Database Transactions:** Rollback scenarios

### Test Performance

- **Average Test Duration:** 1.46ms per test
- **Slowest Tests:** Component render tests with complex contexts
- **Setup Overhead:** 3.71s (can be optimized)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Mock Configuration**

   ```typescript
   // Fix axios mock setup
   vi.mock('axios', () => ({
     default: {
       create: vi.fn(() => ({
         interceptors: {
           request: { use: vi.fn() },
           response: { use: vi.fn() },
         },
         defaults: { headers: { common: {} } },
       })),
     },
   }));
   ```

2. **Resolve TypeScript Errors**
   - Update Prisma schema to match code
   - Fix missing module imports
   - Align type definitions

3. **Add Missing Context Providers**
   ```typescript
   const AllTheProviders = ({ children }) => (
     <ThemeProvider>
       <AuthProvider>
         <WebSocketProvider>
           {children}
         </WebSocketProvider>
       </AuthProvider>
     </ThemeProvider>
   )
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Target: Frontend 70%, Backend 60%
   - Focus on critical user paths
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints

2. **Implement Test Utilities**
   - Create test data factories
   - Shared mock configurations
   - Custom test matchers

3. **Setup CI Coverage Gates**
   - Block PRs below coverage thresholds
   - Track coverage trends
   - Generate coverage badges

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)

1. **Test Architecture Refactoring**
   - Separate unit/integration/e2e tests
   - Implement test pyramid principles
   - Use dependency injection for better testability

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add load testing for API endpoints
   - Monitor frontend render performance
   - Track bundle size impacts

3. **Test Documentation**
   - Create testing guidelines
   - Document mock patterns
   - Maintain test scenario catalog

## Test Execution Commands

### Run All Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Frontend
npm run test:coverage

# Backend
cd backend && npm run test:coverage

# E2E Tests
npm run test:e2e

# Performance Tests
npm run test:e2e tests/performance/
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test src/components

# Integration tests
npm run test tests/integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test --watch
```

## Coverage Thresholds Configuration

### Current Settings

```javascript
// vitest.config.ts
coverage: {
  statements: 70,
  branches: 70,
  functions: 70,
  lines: 70
}
```

### Recommended Adjustments

```javascript
coverage: {
  statements: 60,  // Reduce initially
  branches: 50,    // Allow gradual improvement
  functions: 60,
  lines: 60,
  include: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [
    'src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}',
    'src/**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}',
    'src/test/**/*'
  ]
}
```

## Conclusion

The Cell Segmentation Hub has a solid test infrastructure foundation with comprehensive E2E and performance test suites. However, immediate attention is needed to:

1. Fix failing unit tests (mock configuration issues)
2. Resolve backend compilation errors
3. Increase overall code coverage from current ~30% to target 70%

With the recommended fixes, the project can achieve:

- **70%+ test coverage** within 2 weeks
- **90%+ test stability** within 1 week
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated quality gates immediately

The test infrastructure investments will significantly improve code quality, reduce regression risks, and accelerate development velocity.
