| `R`      | Reset view          | No                 |
| `Delete` | Delete selected     | Yes                |
| `Escape` | Cancel/View mode    | No                 |
| `Tab`    | Cycle modes         | No                 |
| `H/?`    | Show help           | No                 |

## New Edit Modes

1. **View Mode** (`V`): Navigate and select polygons, panning
2. **Edit Vertices** (`E`): Move and modify polygon vertices
3. **Add Points** (`A`): CVAT-style point insertion between vertices
4. **Create Polygon** (`N`): Draw new polygons with auto-closing
5. **Slice** (`S`): Split polygons with a cutting line
6. **Delete Polygon** (`D`): Remove polygons by clicking

## Advanced Features

### CVAT-Style Add Points

- Click start vertex to begin sequence
- Add points along desired path
- Click end vertex to complete
- Intelligent path replacement (chooses larger perimeter)
- Hold Shift for equidistant auto-addition

### Polygon Slicing

- Select polygon to slice
- Click two points to define cutting line
- Automatic validation and splitting
- Creates two new polygons from original

### Visual Feedback

- Mode-specific cursor styles
- Real-time preview lines and geometry
- Context-sensitive instructions overlay
- Mode-aware borders and highlighting

## Technical Improvements

### Performance

- Optimized coordinate transformations
- Efficient event handling with debouncing
- Smart polygon visibility culling
- Memoized rendering components

### Architecture

- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular hook-based design
- Type-safe interfaces throughout
- Backward compatibility during migration

### Developer Experience

- Comprehensive TypeScript types
- Clear component boundaries
- Extensive documentation
- Debugging-friendly structure

## Migration Safety

- All old files backed up with `.old` extension
- Legacy adapter provides compatibility bridge
- Gradual migration approach preserves stability
- Existing data formats fully supported

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Load existing projects and images
   - Verify polygon rendering and interaction
   - Test save/load operations

2. **New Features**
   - Try all edit modes (V,E,A,N,S,D)
   - Test keyboard shortcuts
   - Verify add points and slicing functionality

3. **Performance**
   - Test with large polygon counts
   - Verify smooth zooming and panning
   - Check memory usage during long sessions

## Support & Cleanup

- Old `.old` files can be removed after thorough testing
- Legacy adapter can be simplified once migration is complete
- Performance monitoring recommended during initial rollout

## Next Steps

1. Test thoroughly in development environment
2. Deploy to staging for user acceptance testing
3. Monitor performance and user feedback
4. Remove `.old` backup files after stability confirmed
5. Consider additional enhancements based on user needs
