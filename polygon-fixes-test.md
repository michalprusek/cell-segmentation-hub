# Polygon Visibility Fixes - Test Results

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed polygon state updates when segmentation data loads
- Added `useEffect` in `useEnhancedSegmentationEditor` to watch for `initialPolygons` changes
- Now polygons from neural network are visible immediately when data loads
- Added console logging to track data flow

### 2. Fixed passive event listener warning  
- Replaced React `onWheel` handler with direct DOM event listener
- Used `{ passive: false }` to allow `preventDefault()` calls
- Properly cleaned up event listener on unmount

### 3. Enhanced debugging
- Added console logs to track segmentation data conversion
- Track when polygons are loaded and updated in the editor

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to segmentation editor**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Load an image with existing segmentation results**
3. **Verify neural network polygons are visible**: Should see existing polygons immediately
4. **Test polygon creation**: Switch to "Create New Polygon" mode (blue pen icon)
5. **Verify manual polygon creation**: Click to add points, should see:
   - Green circles for each point
   - Dashed lines connecting points  
   - Preview line to cursor
   - Closing indicator when near first point
6. **Test zooming**: Scroll wheel should zoom without console errors
7. **Check console**: Should see log messages tracking polygon data flow

## Expected Results

### ✅ Neural Network Polygons
- Existing polygons appear immediately when opening segmentation editor
- Console shows: "Converting segmentation data to polygons" with polygon count
- Console shows: "Updated editor with X polygons"

### ✅ Manual Polygon Creation  
- Visual feedback when creating new polygons
- Temporary points and preview lines visible
- Can complete polygons by clicking near start point

### ✅ No Console Errors
- No more "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener" warnings
- Smooth zooming with mouse wheel
