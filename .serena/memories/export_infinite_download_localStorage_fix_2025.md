# Export Infinite Download Loop - localStorage Fix

## Problem
Users reported exports downloading infinitely in a loop. The logs showed:
- "Restoring export state from localStorage" with status: 'downloading' and a jobId
- Downloads triggering repeatedly for the same jobId
- The loop continuing indefinitely even after page refresh

## Root Cause
The ExportStateManager was saving the export state to localStorage with `status: 'downloading'` and a `completedJobId`. However, after a successful download, the state was never cleared from localStorage. When the page reloaded or the component remounted, the persisted state was restored, making the application think there was still a completed export ready for download, which triggered the auto-download useEffect infinitely.

## Solution
Added `ExportStateManager.clearExportState(projectId)` calls in all download completion paths to clear the localStorage state:

### Changes in `/src/pages/export/hooks/useSharedAdvancedExport.ts`:

1. **Auto-download success** (line 512):
```typescript
// Clear localStorage to prevent re-download on page refresh
ExportStateManager.clearExportState(projectId);
```

2. **Auto-download cancellation** (line 536):
```typescript
ExportStateManager.clearExportState(projectId);
```

3. **Manual download success** (line 667):
```typescript
// Clear localStorage to prevent re-download on page refresh
ExportStateManager.clearExportState(projectId);
```

4. **Manual download cancellation** (line 689):
```typescript
ExportStateManager.clearExportState(projectId);
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Before**: Export state persisted in localStorage with `status: 'downloading'`
2. **On page reload**: State restored, triggering auto-download useEffect
3. **After fix**: localStorage cleared immediately after successful download
4. **Result**: No persisted state to trigger downloads on reload

## Key Insights

- The ExportStateManager already had proper cleanup logic for expired states (2-hour expiration)
- The issue was that successful downloads weren't clearing the state
- The state persistence is useful for resuming interrupted exports but should be cleared on completion
- Error cases keep the state to allow manual retry (as designed)

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- ESLint: ✅ No new errors (5 existing warnings)
- The infinite loop should now be completely resolved

## Related Components
- ExportStateManager: Manages localStorage persistence
- useSharedAdvancedExport: Hook handling export logic
- ExportContext: Provides export state to components

## Prevention
Always ensure that localStorage/sessionStorage states are properly cleared when operations complete successfully. Consider implementing automatic cleanup for "terminal" states like completed downloads.
