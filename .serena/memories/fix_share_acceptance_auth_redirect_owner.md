# Fix for Share Acceptance Owner Display After Authentication Redirect

## Problem Description

When an unauthenticated user clicks a share invitation link and must authenticate first (login or register), the shared project appears in their dashboard but shows the wrong owner. It displays the logged-in user as owner instead of the actual project owner.

**Working Scenario**: Already authenticated user clicks share link → Shows correct owner
**Broken Scenario**: Unauthenticated user → Login/Register → Shows wrong owner (current user)

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue: Race Condition & Duplicate Processing

1. **Duplicate Processing**: Both `AuthContext` and `Dashboard` were trying to process the same share token
2. **Race Condition**: Dashboard loaded projects before share acceptance propagated to database
3. **Premature Token Removal**: AuthContext removed the pending token before Dashboard could use it

### Data Flow Problem

**Authentication Flow**:

1. User clicks share link → `ShareAccept.tsx` stores token in localStorage
2. Redirects to login → User authenticates
3. `AuthContext` processes token and accepts share (PROBLEM: Too early)
4. `AuthContext` removes token and navigates to Dashboard
5. Dashboard tries to process token (already removed) and fetches projects
6. Projects API returns stale data (share not yet propagated)
7. Owner appears as current user due to stale/incomplete data

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Duplicate Processing from AuthContext

**Files Modified**: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

- **Lines 176-193**: Removed share processing from `signIn` method
- **Lines 243-260**: Removed share processing from `signUp` method

**Before**:

```typescript
// Process pending share invitation if exists
const pendingToken = localStorage.getItem('pendingShareToken');
if (pendingToken) {
  try {
    const result = await apiClient.acceptShareInvitation(pendingToken);
    localStorage.removeItem('pendingShareToken');
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

**After**:

```typescript
// NOTE: Share invitation processing moved to Dashboard component
// to avoid race conditions and ensure proper data refresh.
// Dashboard will handle the pending share token after navigation.
```

#### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Share Processing

**File Modified**: `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

- **Line 62**: Increased propagation delay from 500ms to 1500ms
- **Line 79**: Added delay for already-accepted shares

**Changes**:

```typescript
// Increased delay to ensure database propagation and API cache refresh
// This prevents race conditions where shared projects are fetched before
// the database has fully propagated the new share relationship
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Single Processing Point**: Only Dashboard handles share acceptance, eliminating duplicate processing
2. **Proper Timing**: Dashboard can coordinate acceptance with data refresh
3. **Sufficient Propagation Delay**: 1500ms ensures database and cache are updated
4. **Forced Refresh**: `fetchProjects()` called after delay ensures fresh data

## Testing Verification

After applying the fix:

1. Clear browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage)
2. Open share link while NOT logged in
3. Login or register as prompted
4. Dashboard should show shared project with CORRECT owner (not current user)

## Key Files Involved

### Frontend

- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Removed duplicate processing
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Enhanced with proper delay and refresh
- `/src/pages/ShareAccept.tsx` - Stores token correctly (unchanged)
- `/src/hooks/useDashboardProjects.ts` - Fetches projects (unchanged)

### Backend (No changes needed)

- Backend correctly returns owner data in all endpoints
- API response structure is correct
- Database queries include proper relations

## Monitoring & Debugging

Watch for these log messages:

- Dashboard: "Processing pending share invitation"
- Dashboard: "Share invitation accepted"
- Dashboard: "Share invitation was already accepted, refreshing projects"

## Prevention Guidelines

1. **Avoid duplicate processing** - Process tokens in one place only
2. **Consider propagation delays** - Database and cache need time to update
3. **Force data refresh** - Always refetch after state changes
4. **Test authentication flows** - Both login and registration paths
5. **Log timing issues** - Add debug logging for race condition detection

- SSOT violations: Duplicate token processing logic
- Pattern needed: Centralized share state management utility
