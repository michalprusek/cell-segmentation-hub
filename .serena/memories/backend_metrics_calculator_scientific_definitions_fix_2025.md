# Backend Metrics Calculator Scientific Definitions Fix

## Overview

Comprehensive update to the backend metric calculation system to match scientific definitions and ensure consistency with the frontend implementation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Interface Updates

- Added `perimeterWithHoles: number` - External perimeter + all hole perimeters
- Added `boundingBoxWidth: number` and `boundingBoxHeight: number` - AABB dimensions
- Added `extent: number` - Area/(BBox.width × BBox.height)
- Updated existing interface to support new scientific definitions

### 2. Fixed Metric Calculations

#### Compactness Formula Fix

**BEFORE**: `compactness: circularity` (duplicate)
**AFTER**: `compactness: (perimeter * perimeter) / (4 * Math.PI * area)` (P²/(4πA))

This is the **reciprocal of circularity** and correctly measures shape compactness.

#### Perimeter with Holes

**NEW**: External perimeter + sum of all hole perimeters

- Matches ImageJ convention for perimeter calculation
- Provides total boundary measurement including holes

#### Extent Calculation

**FIXED**: `extent = area / (boundingBox.width * boundingBox.height)`

- Measures how much of the bounding box is filled by the shape
- Range: [0,1] where 1 = completely fills bounding box

### 3. Rotating Calipers Algorithm

**PORTED** from frontend to backend:

- `calculateConvexHull()` - Graham scan algorithm
- `rotatingCalipers()` - Proper Feret diameter calculations
- `cross()`, `distance()`, `pointToLineDistance()` - Supporting geometry functions

### 4. Enhanced Fallback Calculations

Updated `calculateBasicMetrics()` to use:

- Proper convex hull calculations for convexity and solidity
- Rotating calipers for accurate Feret diameters
- Scientific formulas for all metrics
- Proper hole handling for perimeter calculations

### 5. Export Function Updates

#### Excel Export

- Added new columns: Perimeter with Holes, Bounding Box Width/Height, Extent
- Updated header names for clarity
- Maintained backward compatibility

#### CSV Export

- Added all new metric fields
- Consistent naming with Excel export
- Proper unit labeling (µm/px)

#### Scale Conversion

- Added scaling for new linear measurements (boundingBoxWidth, boundingBoxHeight, perimeterWithHoles)
- Maintained dimensionless ratios unchanged

### 6. Python API Integration

Updated required keys validation to include:

- `PerimeterWithHoles`
- `BoundingBoxWidth`, `BoundingBoxHeight`
- `Extent`

## Scientific Definitions Implemented

| Metric               | Formula                | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Area                 | Shoelace - holes       | Total polygon area minus hole areas       |
| Perimeter            | External boundary only | Perimeter of outer contour                |
| Perimeter with Holes | External + all holes   | Total boundary length including holes     |
| Circularity          | 4πA/P²                 | Measure of roundness, clamped to [0,1]    |
| Compactness          | P²/(4πA)               | Reciprocal of circularity                 |
| Extent               | A/(w×h)                | Fraction of bounding box filled           |
| Solidity             | A/ConvexA              | Ratio of areas (polygon/convex hull)      |
| Convexity            | ConvexP/P              | Ratio of perimeters (convex hull/polygon) |
| Feret Max/Min        | Rotating calipers      | Proper caliper measurements               |

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Maintained** - All existing fields preserved
✅ **Enhanced** - Added new fields without breaking changes
✅ **Scaled** - New fields properly scaled with µm conversion

## Performance Considerations

- **Convex hull calculation**: O(n log n) - efficient Graham scan
- **Rotating calipers**: O(n²) for comprehensive Feret calculations
- **Fallback path**: More accurate but computationally heavier than before
- **Trade-off**: Better accuracy vs. slightly increased computation time

## Files Modified

- `/backend/src/services/metrics/metricsCalculator.ts` - Complete overhaul

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify metric calculations** match frontend implementations
2. **Test hole handling** for perimeter calculations
3. **Validate scale conversions** for new fields
4. **Check export formats** include all new columns
5. **Performance test** with large polygon datasets

## Integration Points

- **ML Service**: Must provide new metric fields in response
- **Frontend**: Already implements correct calculations
- **Export functionality**: Enhanced with new metrics
- **API responses**: Include new fields in polygon metrics

This implementation ensures the backend metric calculations are scientifically accurate and consistent with established image analysis standards.
