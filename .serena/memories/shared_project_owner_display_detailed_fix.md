# Shared Project Owner Display Issue - Detailed Analysis and Fix

## Problem Description

After logout and re-login, shared projects show the wrong owner (showing the current user instead of the actual project owner). The console logs show that the owner data is correctly fetched from the backend but incorrectly displayed in the UI.

## Console Evidence

```javascript
// Console shows correct data is fetched:
Processing shared project: {
  projectId: '39c7b069-3684-4a83-afd0-3f73d43506b7',
  hasOwner: true,
  ownerEmail: '12bprusek@gym-nymburk.cz',  // Correct owner
  sharedByEmail: '12bprusek@gym-nymburk.cz'
}
// But UI shows owner as 'prusemic@cvut.cz' (wrong)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. Backend correctly sends owner data in the response structure:

   ```javascript
   {
     project: {
       id: "...",
       name: "...",
       title: "...",
       owner: { id: "...", email: "12bprusek@..." }  // Correct
     },
     sharedBy: { ... },
     shareId: "..."
   }
   ```

2. The `useDashboardProjects` hook processes this data but there's a data mapping issue

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Data Mapping (`/src/hooks/useDashboardProjects.ts`)

```javascript
// Ensure owner data is preserved during mapping
const sharedProjectData = {
  ...project,
  name: project.name || project.title,
  title: project.title || project.name,
  isOwned: false,
  isShared: true,
  sharedBy: p.sharedBy,
  owner: project.owner, // Explicitly preserve owner
  shareStatus: p.status,
  shareId: p.shareId,
};

// Add validation to detect owner data loss
if (!sharedProjectData.owner && project.owner) {
  logger.error('Owner data lost during mapping!', {
    originalOwner: project.owner,
    mappedOwner: sharedProjectData.owner,
  });
}
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging

- Log before processing to see raw data
- Log after processing to track transformations
- Log shared project details specifically

## Components Involved

1. **Backend**: `/backend/src/api/controllers/sharingController.ts` - Sends correct data
2. **API Client**: `/src/lib/api.ts` - Fetches shared projects
3. **Hook**: `/src/hooks/useDashboardProjects.ts` - Processes and maps project data
4. **Components**:
   - `/src/components/ProjectsList.tsx` - Passes owner prop
   - `/src/components/ProjectCard.tsx` - Displays owner (line 105-111)
   - `/src/components/ProjectListItem.tsx` - Displays owner in list view

## Testing Steps

1. User A shares project with User B
2. User B accepts and sees correct owner
3. User B logs out and logs back in
4. Check console for debug logs
5. Verify owner is correctly displayed as User A

## Related Issues Fixed

- Route mismatch for `/api/shared/projects`
- Race conditions in share acceptance
- Queue permissions for shared projects
- Toast notification persistence
