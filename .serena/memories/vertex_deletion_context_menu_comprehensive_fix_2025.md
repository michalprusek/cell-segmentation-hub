# Comprehensive Vertex Deletion Context Menu Fix

## Problem Summary

The vertex deletion context menu was not working properly. Users could not right-click on vertices to access the "Delete Point" option due to event propagation issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Canvas-level right-click interception**: The `useAdvancedInteractions.tsx` hook was intercepting ALL right-click events (lines 383-418) and calling `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` regardless of whether the click was on a vertex.
2. **Missing event propagation control**: The basic `CanvasVertex.tsx` component had no event handlers to control event bubbling.
3. **Component architecture**: An improved version `CanvasVertex.improved.tsx` existed with proper event handling but wasn't being used.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Event Propagation in useAdvancedInteractions.tsx

**File**: `/src/pages/segmentation/hooks/useAdvancedInteractions.tsx`

**Key Changes**:

- Added `isVertexTarget()` utility function to detect vertex elements by checking for `data-polygon-id` and `data-vertex-index` attributes
- Modified right-click handler to allow context menu events on vertices:

  ```typescript
  // Right-click - handle step-by-step undo OR allow vertex context menu
  if (e.button === 2) {
    // CRITICAL FIX: Check if we clicked on a vertex before intercepting the event
    const target = e.target as SVGElement;

    // If this is a vertex, allow the context menu to proceed
    if (isVertexTarget(target)) {
      // Don't prevent default or stop propagation for vertex right-clicks
      // This allows the VertexContextMenu to work properly
      return;
    }

    // Not a vertex - proceed with existing step-by-step undo logic
    // ... existing logic for slice mode, etc.
  }
  ```

### 2. Switched to Improved CanvasVertex Component

**Files**:

- `/src/pages/segmentation/components/canvas/PolygonVertices.tsx`
- `/src/pages/segmentation/components/EnhancedSegmentationEditor.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Updated imports from `CanvasVertex` to `CanvasVertex.improved`
- The improved component includes proper event handlers:
  ```typescript
  const handleMouseDown = React.useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    // Stop propagation to prevent polygon selection
    e.stopPropagation();
    // Let the event bubble up with data attributes intact
  }, []);
  ```

### 3. Enhanced VertexContextMenu Event Isolation

**File**: `/src/pages/segmentation/components/context-menu/VertexContextMenu.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Added event isolation to prevent context menu interactions from bubbling:

  ```typescript
  const handleDelete = React.useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    // Stop propagation to prevent polygon deselection
    e.stopPropagation();
    onDelete();
  }, [onDelete]);

  <ContextMenuContent
    className="w-64"
    onMouseDown={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
    onMouseUp={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
    onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
  >
  ```

### 4. SSOT Consolidation

**Cleanup**:

- Removed basic `/src/pages/segmentation/components/canvas/CanvasVertex.tsx`
- Renamed `CanvasVertex.improved.tsx` to `CanvasVertex.tsx` (canonical name)
- Updated all imports to use the canonical component
- Updated test files to match canonical naming

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Right-click on vertex** → Context menu appears and stays open  
✅ **Click "Delete Point"** → Vertex gets deleted without polygon deselection  
✅ **Right-click on polygon (non-vertex)** → Existing slice mode undo functionality still works  
✅ **Polygon selection** → Remains stable during vertex operations

## Integration Points Verified

1. **Event Detection**: Uses `data-vertex-index` attribute to distinguish vertex clicks from other canvas interactions
2. **Event Propagation**: `stopPropagation()` in vertex context menu handlers prevents bubbling to polygon selection logic
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing right-click functionality preserved for non-vertex areas (slice mode step-by-step undo, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **Primary Fix**: `/src/pages/segmentation/hooks/useAdvancedInteractions.tsx`
2. **Component Switch**: `/src/pages/segmentation/components/canvas/PolygonVertices.tsx`
3. **Component Switch**: `/src/pages/segmentation/components/EnhancedSegmentationEditor.tsx`
4. **Event Isolation**: `/src/pages/segmentation/components/context-menu/VertexContextMenu.tsx`
5. **SSOT Cleanup**: Removed basic `CanvasVertex.tsx`, renamed improved version to canonical name
6. **Test Updates**: Updated test imports and corrected test setup for SVG rendering

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Vertex Detection Logic**: Checks for `data-vertex-index` attribute on event target
- **Event Flow**: Vertex right-clicks bypass canvas-level interception, allowing Radix UI ContextMenu to work
- **Performance**: Maintains all existing optimizations and memoization
- **Type Safety**: All changes are TypeScript-compliant with proper type checking

## Testing Verification

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passes
- Linting: ✅ No critical errors (only minor warnings)
- Component tests: ✅ Fixed SVG rendering in test environment
- Integration: ✅ All major canvas interactions preserved

## Key Lessons

1. **Event Propagation Order**: Canvas-level event handlers should check for specific element targets before intercepting events
2. **Component Architecture**: Having improved versions of components is beneficial, but they need to be actively used
3. **SSOT Principles**: Remove duplicate components and maintain single canonical versions
4. **Testing SVG Components**: SVG elements need proper container setup in test environments

This fix resolves the vertex deletion context menu issue while maintaining full backward compatibility and following SSOT methodology.
