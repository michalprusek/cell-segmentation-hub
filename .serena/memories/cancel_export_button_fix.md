# Cancel Export Button Fix Solution

## Problem

The cancel export button showed success toast but didn't actually cancel the export. The button remained in "Cancel Export" state instead of reverting to "Advanced Export", and the download still completed.

## Root Cause

The ProjectToolbar component was using its own local state (`useState`) for `isExporting` and `isDownloading` instead of using the states from the `useAdvancedExport` hook. This created a disconnect where:

1. The hook would update its internal state on cancel
2. But the component's local state remained unchanged
3. So the button UI didn't update

## Solution Applied

### 1. Remove Local State Management

Changed from:

```typescript
const [isExporting, setIsExporting] = useState(false);
const [isDownloading, setIsDownloading] = useState(false);
const { cancelExport } = useAdvancedExport(projectId);
```

To:

```typescript
const { cancelExport, isExporting, isDownloading } =
  useAdvancedExport(projectId);
```

### 2. Remove State Setters

Removed all `setIsExporting()` and `setIsDownloading()` calls since the state is now managed by the hook.

### 3. Simplify Cancel Handler

Changed from manually setting states to just calling the cancel function:

```typescript
const handleCancelExport = async () => {
  try {
    await cancelExport();
    toast.success(t('export.cancelled'));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to cancel export:', error);
    toast.error(t('export.cancelFailed'));
  }
};
```

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/project/ProjectToolbar.tsx` - Main fix location
- Hook `/src/pages/export/hooks/useAdvancedExport.ts` already had proper implementation

## Key Learnings

1. Always use centralized state management from hooks
2. Avoid duplicate state between components and hooks
3. The `useAdvancedExport` hook properly handles all export states including cancellation
4. State synchronization issues can cause UI to not reflect actual backend state

## Testing

1. Click "Advanced Export" button
2. Start export
3. Click "Cancel Export" immediately
4. Button should change to "Advanced Export" immediately
5. No download should occur
6. Success toast should appear
