# Upload Cancellation Orange Warning Fix

## Problem Description

When users cancel image uploads mid-process, they correctly see a success toast notification, but also receive an unwanted orange warning notification about failed uploads. This creates confusing UX where both success and warning messages appear.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `/src/components/ImageUploader.tsx` at lines 300-312. The chunked upload success handler showed an orange warning toast whenever `result.failed.length > 0`, without checking if the upload was user-cancelled.

When users cancel during chunked uploads:

1. `uploadCancelledRef.current` is set to `true`
2. Some chunks naturally fail due to cancellation
3. Success toast shows correctly: "Upload cancelled successfully"
4. But failed chunk check at line 300 also triggers orange warning: "X files uploaded successfully, Y failed"

## Solution Implemented

**File:** `/src/components/ImageUploader.tsx`
**Line:** 300
**Change:** Added `&& !uploadCancelledRef.current` condition

```typescript
// Before:
if (result.failed.length > 0) {

// After:
if (result.failed.length > 0 && !uploadCancelledRef.current) {
```

## User Experience Flow (Fixed)

1. User clicks cancel during chunked upload ✅
2. `handleCancelUpload()` sets `uploadCancelledRef.current = true` ✅
3. Success toast appears: "Upload cancelled successfully" ✅
4. Orange warning is suppressed due to cancellation check ✅
5. User redirected to image gallery cleanly ✅

## Technical Details

- **Success toast implementation:** Already working correctly at lines 486-489
- **Translation keys:** Available in all 6 languages (uploadCancelledSuccess)
- **Cancellation detection:** Robust with multiple error types checked
- **State management:** uploadCancelledRef properly tracks user cancellation vs actual failures

## Testing Scenarios Verified

- Small batch cancellation (≤100 files)
- Large batch cancellation (>100 files, chunked)
- Rapid cancel/re-upload cycles
- Network interruption vs user cancellation distinction

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/ImageUploader.tsx` - Added cancellation check to prevent warning

## Architecture Impact

- **Minimal change:** Single line condition addition
- **No breaking changes:** Preserves all existing functionality
- **SSOT maintained:** Uses existing uploadCancelledRef for state consistency
- **Translation system:** Utilizes existing localized toast messages

This fix ensures users get clear, single-message feedback when cancelling uploads without confusing dual notifications.
