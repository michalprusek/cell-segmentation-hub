# Polygon Visibility Rendering Fix - September 2025

## Problem Summary

Polygons were loaded correctly in the segmentation editor but not visually rendering due to incorrect viewport calculation in the visibility culling system.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `/src/lib/rendering/PolygonVisibilityManager.ts` in the `calculateViewport()` method (lines 192-199). The viewport bounds calculation was incorrect:

**Before (Incorrect):**

```typescript
return {
  x: -offset.x,
  y: -offset.y,
  width: containerWidth / zoom,
  height: containerHeight / zoom,
};
```

**After (Fixed):**

```typescript
return {
  x: -offset.x / zoom,
  y: -offset.y / zoom,
  width: containerWidth / zoom,
  height: containerHeight / zoom,
};
```

The offset values needed to be divided by zoom to get correct viewport coordinates in image space, matching the polygon coordinate system.

## Comprehensive Fix Implementation

### 1. Primary Viewport Calculation Fix

- Fixed the viewport calculation to use `offset.x / zoom` and `offset.y / zoom`
- Ensures viewport coordinates match the polygon coordinate system
- Located in `PolygonVisibilityManager.ts` lines 196-199

### 2. Fallback Safety Mechanism

- Added fallback to always render all polygons when count is very low (< 10)
- Prevents over-aggressive culling that could hide all polygons
- Critical for debugging and edge cases

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging

- Added development-mode debug logging for visibility decisions
- Helps diagnose future visibility issues
- Shows polygon counts, culling decisions, and viewport information

### 4. Integration Architecture

The PolygonVisibilityManager is integrated into the rendering pipeline through:

- `CanvasPolygonLayer.tsx` (lines 22, 205-211) - Main integration point
- `OptimizedPolygonRenderer.tsx` - Uses visibility results for rendering
- `RenderBatchManager.ts` - Works with visible polygons for batching

## Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/rendering/PolygonVisibilityManager.ts` - Primary fix location
2. `/src/lib/rendering/__tests__/PolygonVisibilityManager.test.ts` - Comprehensive test coverage

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive unit tests covering:

- Viewport calculation with various zoom levels
- Small polygon count fallback mechanism
- Selected polygon force rendering
- Debug logging functionality
- All tests pass âœ…

## Impact

- **Fixed:** Polygons now render correctly in segmentation editor
- **Performance:** Maintains optimized frustum culling for large datasets
- **Reliability:** Fallback prevents invisible polygon scenarios
- **Debugging:** Enhanced logging for future troubleshooting

## Related Systems

- **Visibility System:** PolygonVisibilityManager handles frustum culling
- **Rendering Pipeline:** OptimizedPolygonRenderer uses visibility results
- **Batch Management:** RenderBatchManager processes visible polygons
- **Canvas Layer:** CanvasPolygonLayer orchestrates the rendering

## Prevention

- Unit tests ensure viewport calculation correctness
- Debug logging aids in diagnosing future visibility issues
- Fallback mechanism prevents total polygon invisibility
- Documentation of coordinate space relationships

This fix resolves the core polygon visibility issue while maintaining the performance optimizations and adding safeguards against similar problems in the future.
