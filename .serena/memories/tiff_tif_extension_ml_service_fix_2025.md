# TIFF Single Extension (.tif) ML Service Segmentation Fix

## Problem Description

Date: 2025-09-26
Issue: TIFF images with `.tif` extension (single 'f') were failing during segmentation with 400 Bad Request errors from ML service.

### Symptoms

- Upload appeared successful but showed "Upload failed" message
- ML service returned 400 Bad Request for `.tif` files
- Segmentation status changed from queued â†’ processing â†’ failed
- Only affected `.tif` files, while `.tiff` files worked fine

### Error Logs

```
INFO: 172.18.0.6:58120 - "POST /api/v1/segment HTTP/1.1" 400 Bad Request
[WARN] ðŸ”´ SEGMENTATION UPDATE RECEIVED: {imageId: '...', status: 'failed', ...}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug

Location: `/backend/segmentation/api/routes.py` line 41

**Before (BROKEN):**

```python
valid_extensions = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.tiff', '.bmp'}  # Missing .tif
```

**After (FIXED):**

```python
valid_extensions = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.tiff', '.tif', '.bmp'}  # Added .tif
```

### Why It Happened

1. The ML service validation function only accepted `.tiff` (double 'f') extension
2. Many TIFF files use `.tif` (single 'f') following 3-letter extension convention
3. Validation rejected `.tif` files before they reached the image processing pipeline
4. Ironically, the underlying PIL/PyTorch processing would handle both formats correctly

### Validation Chain

```
Backend (Node.js) â†’ Accepts both .tif and .tiff
    â†“
ML Service Validation â†’ REJECTED .tif files (400 Bad Request)
    â†“ (never reached for .tif)
PIL Image Processing â†’ Would work for both formats
```

## Solution Implementation

### Files Modified

1. `/backend/segmentation/api/routes.py`
   - Line 41: Added `.tif` to valid_extensions set
   - Line 131: Updated error message to include TIF format
   - Line 242: Updated batch error message to include TIF format

### Changes Applied

```python
# Line 41
valid_extensions = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.tiff', '.tif', '.bmp'}

# Line 131 & 242
"Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, TIF, BMP"
```

## Testing & Verification

### Test Results

```
ðŸ“¤ Testing: file.tif
   Extension: .tif
âœ… SUCCESS! File accepted and processed

ðŸ“¤ Testing: file.tiff
   Extension: .tiff
âœ… SUCCESS! File accepted and processed
```

### Verification Steps

1. Restart ML service: `docker restart blue-ml`
2. Test with both `.tif` and `.tiff` files
3. Confirm segmentation completes successfully
4. Check polygons are detected and returned

## Related Components

### Working Correctly (No Changes Needed)

- Backend image controller - Already accepts both formats
- Storage service - Handles both extensions properly
- Thumbnail generation - Converts TIFF to JPEG correctly
- Display endpoint - Converts TIFF to PNG for browser viewing
- Frontend TIFF utilities - Handle both extensions

### ML Service Components

- `/backend/segmentation/services/inference.py` - Already supported both formats
- `/backend/segmentation/utils/model_loader.py` - PIL handles both correctly
- Only the validation layer was blocking `.tif` files

## Lessons Learned

1. **Validation Consistency**: Ensure file extension validation matches across all services
2. **Common Conventions**: Support both common variants (.tif/.tiff, .jpg/.jpeg, etc.)
3. **Error Messages**: 400 Bad Request at validation layer prevented deeper debugging
4. **Testing Coverage**: Need tests for all file extension variants

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Centralize Format Definitions**: Create single source of truth for supported formats
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all common file extension variants
3. **Validation Alignment**: Ensure frontend, backend, and ML service accept same formats
4. **Better Error Logging**: Log specific validation failures with details

## Quick Reference

### Issue

- `.tif` files â†’ 400 Bad Request from ML service

### Fix

- Add `.tif` to `valid_extensions` in `/backend/segmentation/api/routes.py`

### Commands

```bash
# Restart ML service after fix
docker restart blue-ml

# Check logs
docker logs blue-ml --tail 50

# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:4008/api/v1/segment \
  -F "file=@test.tif" \
  -F "model=hrnet"
```
