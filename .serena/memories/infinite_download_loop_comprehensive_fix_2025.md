# Comprehensive Fix for Infinite Export Download Loop

## Problem Description

Users reported exports downloading repeatedly in an infinite loop. The console showed continuous "Export auto-downloaded" messages with the same jobId. The download could not be stopped and would continue indefinitely.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing React Hook Dependencies

The useEffect responsible for auto-downloading was missing `currentProjectName` from its dependency array, causing React to not properly track state changes.

### 2. Lack of Download Tracking

The main issue was that there was no mechanism to track which export jobs had already been downloaded. When the `completedJobId` state was present, the useEffect would fire on every re-render, even if the file had already been downloaded.

### 3. State Update Timing Issues

The `completedJobId` was cleared after 5 seconds via setTimeout, but during this window, any component re-render would retrigger the download effect, causing multiple downloads of the same file.

## Complete Solution Implementation

### Changes Made in `/src/pages/export/hooks/useSharedAdvancedExport.ts`

1. **Added download tracking state** (line 74):

```typescript
const [downloadedJobIds, setDownloadedJobIds] = useState<Set<string>>(
  new Set()
);
```

2. **Updated useEffect condition** (line 444):

```typescript
// Before:
if (completedJobId && currentJob?.status !== 'cancelled') {

// After:
if (completedJobId && currentJob?.status !== 'cancelled' && !downloadedJobIds.has(completedJobId)) {
```

3. **Mark jobs as downloaded** (line 492):

```typescript
// After successful download
setDownloadedJobIds(prev => new Set([...prev, completedJobId]));
```

4. **Clear tracking on new export** (line 550):

```typescript
// In startExport function
setDownloadedJobIds(new Set());
```

5. **Fixed dependency array** (line 536):

```typescript
}, [completedJobId, projectId, updateState, currentJob, getSignal, currentProjectName, downloadedJobIds]);
```

## How It Works

1. **Prevention**: The `downloadedJobIds` Set tracks all job IDs that have been downloaded in the current session
2. **Guard Clause**: The useEffect checks if a job has already been downloaded before attempting to download it again
3. **State Management**: When download succeeds, the job ID is added to the Set, preventing future re-downloads
4. **Reset on New Export**: When starting a new export, the Set is cleared to allow downloading the new export

## Technical Details

- Uses a Set data structure for O(1) lookup performance
- Immutable state updates to ensure React properly tracks changes
- Cleared on component unmount (automatic with useState)
- Persists across re-renders but not page refreshes

## Testing Verification

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- ESLint: ✅ No new errors introduced
- The fix prevents infinite loops while still allowing:
  - Auto-download on export completion
  - Manual re-export and download
  - Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Prevention Guidelines

1. Always include all dependencies in useEffect dependency arrays
2. Use guard mechanisms (like tracking Sets) for effects that should only run once per trigger
3. Be cautious with setTimeout/setInterval in useEffect - ensure proper cleanup
4. Consider using useRef for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

## Related Issues Fixed

- Infinite download loop
- Multiple simultaneous downloads of the same export
- Browser performance degradation from repeated download attempts
- User inability to stop the download process
