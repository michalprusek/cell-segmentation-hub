# Per-File Upload Progress with WebSocket Implementation

## Problem

User uploaded 490 images and the progress bar was updating in chunks (100 files at a time) rather than showing progress for each individual file. This resulted in poor UX with large jumps in the progress bar.

## Root Cause

The upload system was using chunked uploads for performance but only tracking progress at the chunk level, not the individual file level. All files within a chunk showed the same progress percentage.

## Solution Overview

Implemented a dual-progress system:

1. **HTTP Progress**: Tracks network transfer at chunk level
2. **WebSocket Progress**: Emits real-time events for each individual file

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. ImageUploader.tsx (lines 43-103)

- Added WebSocket hook to listen for `uploadProgress` and `uploadCompleted` events
- Updates individual file progress based on WebSocket events
- Shows real-time status messages for each file
- Updates both individual file and overall progress

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!socket || !isUploading) return;

  const handleUploadProgress = (data: UploadProgressData) => {
    // Update individual file by matching filename and size
    setFiles(prev =>
      prev.map(f => {
        if (f.name === data.filename && f.size === data.fileSize) {
          return {
            ...f,
            uploadProgress: data.progress,
            status: data.currentFileStatus,
          };
        }
        return f;
      })
    );
    setUploadProgress(data.percentComplete);
  };

  socket.on('uploadProgress', handleUploadProgress);
  socket.on('uploadCompleted', handleUploadCompleted);
});
```

#### 2. Fixed File Progress Calculation (lines 101-113)

- Files in completed chunks: 100% progress
- Files in current chunk: Real-time chunk progress
- Files in pending chunks: 0% progress

### Backend Changes

#### 1. WebSocket Types (backend/src/types/websocket.ts)

Added new event types and interfaces:

- `UPLOAD_PROGRESS`: Per-file progress updates
- `UPLOAD_COMPLETED`: Batch completion summary
- `UploadProgressData`: Contains filename, progress, status, batch info

#### 2. ImageController (backend/src/api/controllers/imageController.ts)

- Generates unique batch ID for tracking
- Calls new `uploadImagesWithProgress` method
- Emits WebSocket events via callback

#### 3. ImageService (backend/src/services/imageService.ts)

New `uploadImagesWithProgress` method:

- Processes files sequentially
- Emits progress at key stages (0%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Handles individual file failures gracefully
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy `uploadImages` method

## WebSocket Event Flow

1. **Upload Start**: Emit 0% progress, status: 'uploading'
2. **Storage Upload**: Emit 50% progress, status: 'uploading'
3. **Processing**: Emit 75% progress, status: 'processing'
4. **Complete**: Emit 100% progress, status: 'completed'
5. **Batch Complete**: Emit summary with success/failure counts

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Sequential Processing**: Files processed one-by-one to enable accurate progress
2. **Dual Progress**: HTTP for chunks, WebSocket for individual files
3. **File Identification**: Uses filename + filesize composite key
4. **Error Resilience**: Failed files don't stop batch, users get immediate feedback
5. **SSOT Pattern**: Reused existing WebSocket infrastructure and patterns

## Performance Considerations

- WebSocket events are lightweight (minimal data)
- Rate limiting configured to handle 100 req/s for upload endpoints
- Progress events throttled to key stages to avoid overwhelming connection
- Supports 10,000 file batch limit (configured in backend)

## Testing

Successfully built and deployed to blue environment. Containers healthy and running.

## Files Modified

### Frontend

- `/src/components/ImageUploader.tsx` - Added WebSocket listeners
- `/src/hooks/useProjectData.tsx` - Fixed syntax error (unrelated bug fix)

### Backend

- `/backend/src/types/websocket.ts` - Added upload event types
- `/backend/src/api/controllers/imageController.ts` - WebSocket integration
- `/backend/src/services/imageService.ts` - Added progress tracking method

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry mechanism for failed files
2. Implement pause/resume functionality
3. Add bandwidth throttling options
4. Create shared progress component following BatchSegmentationProgress pattern
5. Add progress persistence for connection interruptions
