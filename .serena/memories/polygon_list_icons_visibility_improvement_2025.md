# Polygon List Icons Visibility Improvement

## Date: 2025-09-22

## Overview

Implemented permanent visibility for polygon action icons (eye and three dots menu) in the segmentation editor's PolygonListPanel, replacing the hover-based visibility pattern.

## Problem

- Icons were only visible on hover (`opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`)
- Poor discoverability, especially on touch devices
- Inconsistent with PolygonItem.tsx which had always-visible icons

## Solution

Modified `/src/pages/segmentation/components/PolygonListPanel.tsx`:

### Changes Made (Line 218-246):

1. Removed hover-based visibility from container div:
   - FROM: `<div className="flex items-center gap-1 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity">`
   - TO: `<div className="flex items-center gap-1">`

2. Added subtle always-visible pattern to individual buttons:
   - Added `opacity-60 hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity` to both Button components
   - This matches the pattern used in PolygonItem.tsx

## Pattern Consistency

The codebase has two UI patterns for action icons:

1. **Hover-reveal pattern**: Used in image lists (completely hidden until hover)
2. **Always-visible-but-subtle pattern**: Used in PolygonItem.tsx (60% opacity, 100% on hover)

We chose pattern #2 for PolygonListPanel to:

- Maintain consistency within polygon-related components
- Improve discoverability
- Support touch devices better
- Follow existing tested patterns

## Files Modified

- `/src/pages/segmentation/components/PolygonListPanel.tsx` (Lines 218, 223, 242)

## Testing Verified

- TypeScript compilation: âœ… Pass
- Icons now permanently visible at 60% opacity
- Hover still enhances visibility to 100%
- Click handlers remain functional
- No performance impact

## Related Components

- **PolygonItem.tsx**: Already implements this pattern (reference implementation)
- **SegmentationEditor.tsx**: Uses PolygonListPanel (no changes needed)
- **RegionPanel.tsx**: Uses PolygonItem (already has permanent icons)

## UX Benefits

- Improved discoverability of polygon actions
- Better touch device support
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Reduced cognitive load (no need to "hunt" for actions)
