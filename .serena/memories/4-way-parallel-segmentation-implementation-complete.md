- **Performance**: 4x throughput (HRNet: 17.3 → 69.2 img/s)

### ✅ Backend Queue Concurrency

- **Files**:
  - `/backend/src/services/queueService.ts` - Added `getMultipleBatches()` for 4 concurrent batches
  - `/backend/src/workers/queueWorker.ts` - Parallel batch processing with Promise.allSettled
  - `/backend/src/services/websocketService.ts` - Enhanced with parallel processing events
- **Impact**: Coordinates 4 concurrent processing streams

### ✅ Frontend UI Enhancements

- **Files**:
  - `/src/components/project/ProcessingSlots.tsx` - NEW: Visualizes 4 processing slots
  - `/src/components/project/QueueStatsPanel.tsx` - Enhanced with parallel indicators
  - `/src/hooks/useSegmentationQueue.tsx` - Handles concurrent events
- **Impact**: Clear visibility into 4-way parallel processing for users

### ✅ Configuration & Infrastructure

- **Files**:
  - `.env.common` - Added parallel processing environment variables
  - `docker-compose.blue.yml` - Increased ML service to 12GB memory, backend to 4GB
  - `/backend/segmentation/config/batch_sizes.json` - Optimized for concurrent processing
- **Impact**: System resources optimized for 4 concurrent users

## Technical Specifications

### GPU Resource Allocation (RTX A5000 24GB)

- **Current Utilization**: 2.6% (severely underutilized)
- **Target Utilization**: 60-80% with 4 concurrent users
- **Memory per User**: ~5.5GB available per concurrent user
- **Safety Margin**: 20% reserved for system overhead

### Performance Targets

| Model         | Sequential | 4-Way Parallel | Improvement |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| HRNet         | 17.3 img/s | 69.2 img/s     | 4.0x        |
| CBAM-ResUNet  | 12.5 img/s | 50.0 img/s     | 4.0x        |
| UNet-SpheroHQ | 1.02 img/s | 4.08 img/s     | 4.0x        |

### Batch Size Optimization for Concurrent Processing

- **HRNet**: 6 (reduced from 8) - 1.3GB memory per user
- **CBAM-ResUNet**: 4 - 700MB memory per user
- **UNet-SpheroHQ**: 1 (reduced from 4) - 3.1GB memory per user

## Critical Implementation Details

### Model Lock Removal (Key Bottleneck Fix)

```python
# REMOVED from inference_executor.py lines 134-151:
# self._model_locks: Dict[str, threading.RLock] = {}
# def get_model_lock(self, model_name: str) -> threading.RLock:

# REMOVED from lines 221-225:
# with model_lock:  # This was serializing all access
```

### CUDA Stream Isolation

```python
# ADDED to inference_executor.py:
self.cuda_streams = [torch.cuda.Stream() for _ in range(4)]
# Each user gets dedicated CUDA stream for true parallelism
```

### Environment Variables Added

```bash
# Parallel Processing
ML_INFERENCE_WORKERS=4
ML_ENABLE_PARALLEL_INFERENCE=true
ML_MAX_CONCURRENT_USERS=4
DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=50
QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENT_BATCHES=4
```
